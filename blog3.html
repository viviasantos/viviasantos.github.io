    <h3>⚡ How to Structure Scrum Ceremonies for Agile and Valuable Deliveries ⚡</h3>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>I want to share my experience implementing and leading Scrum ceremonies in short 2-week sprints. One of the biggest lessons I learned in practice is the importance of breaking down deliveries into small pieces that already add value to the client, so they don’t have to wait long and can quickly see real benefits.</p>
      <p>Besides that, using Scrum ceremonies brings clear gains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improves team alignment 🤝</li>
        <li>Helps identify and mitigate risks ⚠️</li>
        <li>Enhances communication 🗣️</li>
        <li>Keeps focus on delivering continuous and sustainable value 🚀</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>📝 1. Sprint Planning: Planning with Scrum Poker and Business Alignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We start each sprint with a planning meeting using <strong>Scrum Poker</strong> 🃏 to estimate tasks collaboratively and accurately.</li>
        <li>Before the planning session, I align with the business team 🤝 to understand:
          <ul>
            <li>Risks ⚠️</li>
            <li>Urgency ⏰</li>
            <li>Impact 🚀</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Team conversations during planning help to:
          <ul>
            <li>Clear doubts 💬</li>
            <li>Identify dependencies 🔗</li>
            <li>Estimate effort required for each task</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🔄 2. Daily Scrum: Daily Communication to Remove Blockers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Short meeting (15 minutes ⏳)</li>
        <li>Each team member shares:
          <ul>
            <li>What they did yesterday</li>
            <li>What they plan to do today</li>
            <li>Any blockers 🚧</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Helps the team stay synchronized and proactive</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🎯 3. Sprint Review: Showing Real Value to the Client</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>At the end of the sprint, we present deliveries to stakeholders 👥</li>
        <li>Opportunity to get feedback 🗣️ and validate priorities</li>
        <li>Ensures what we deliver is useful and relevant</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🔍 4. Sprint Retrospective: Continuous Process Improvement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Happens right after the Sprint Review</li>
        <li>We discuss:
          <ul>
            <li>What went well ✅</li>
            <li>What could improve 🔧</li>
            <li>Define concrete actions for the next sprint 🚀</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Promotes team evolution and quality improvement</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>💡 Final Thoughts</h3>
