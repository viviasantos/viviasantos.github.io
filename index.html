								<h3><a href="https://github.com/viviasantos/restapi-projects">ServiceNow REST API Incident Extractor</a></h3>
								<ul>
									<b>Description:</b> This Python project connects to the ServiceNow REST API to retrieve incident records and export them into an Excel file using pandas. It demonstrates how to securely access, process, and export data from a ServiceNow instance..<br>
									<br>
									</ul>
									<b>🚀 ✅ USER STORY:</b> 
									<ul>
									As an integration developer, I want an external system to be able to fetch open incidents from ServiceNow so we can display them in a table. </b>
									<br>
									</ul>	
			
									<b>🚀 What This Project Does:</b> 
									<ul>
										- Connects to the ServiceNow Incident Table using the REST API.<br>
										- Authenticates with basic credentials.<br>
										- Sends a GET request with custom query filters.<br>
										- Parses the JSON response into a pandas DataFrame.<br>
										- Extracts relevant fields (e.g., incident_number, state, sys_updated_on).<br>
										- Exports the data to an .xlsx file.<br>
										- Handles pagination to retrieve more than 100 records if needed.<br>
									</ul>
									<b>🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:</b> 
									<ul>
										- 🔗 ServiceNow REST API – For accessing incident data.<br>
										- 📡 REST API Explorer – For building and testing the endpoint.<br>
										- 🐍 Python 3 – Core scripting language.<br>
										- 📦 requests, pandas – requests for API communication/pandas for data manipulation/export<br>
										- 💻 Visual Studio Code – IDE for development.<br>
										- 📁 Output: .xlsx file containing incident records.<br>
									</ul>

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/felipedds/marketing-campaign">Marketing Campaign</a></h3>
								<ul>
									<b>Description:</b> In this case we are dealing with some account types, where there are normal ways in which sales are created and we have marketing tactics that we can utilize to drive the sales, such as Flyers, Emails, Phones and Visits. However some of these tactics are going to work with some of the accounts better than others, not all marketing tactics are equally effective.<br>
									<b>Objective:</b> This project has as a objective to help we answer these questions:<br>
									- What is the impact of each marketing strategy and sales visit on Sales (Amount Collected)?<br>
									- Is the same strategy valid for all the different client types?<br>
									<b>Implications:</b> Based on the analysis, it is evident that several factors are associated with the amount of accounts collected. Particularly, the sales contacts emerged as the most influential drivers of return on investment. Therefore, allocating additional resources to these areas would enhance the effectiveness of the overall campaign.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/felipedds/economic-analysis-fred">Economic Analysis Consumer Price Index - USA</a></h3>
								<ul>
									<b>Description:</b> This project aims to predict the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the United States by leveraging various economic indicators. The CPI is a crucial measure of inflation, reflecting changes in the cost of living over time. By accurately forecasting CPI movements, policymakers, economists, and businesses can make informed decisions about monetary policy, budgeting, and investment strategies. Such data was obtained from FRED.<br>
									<b>Objective:</b> The primary goal is to build a robust predictive model capable of forecasting CPI movements based on changes in the selected economic indicators. The model's performance will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error or root mean squared error, to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.<br>
									<b>Implications:</b> Accurate CPI predictions have significant implications for various stakeholders, including policymakers, investors, businesses, and consumers. Understanding future inflation trends can inform monetary policy decisions, asset allocation strategies, pricing decisions, and budget planning.

								<h3><a href="https://github.com/felipedds/weather-analysis">Weather Analysis</a></h3>
								<ul>
									<b>Problem Statement:</b> Understand the factors affecting air temperature and build a predictive model to forecast air temperature based on weather parameters.<br>
									<b>Context:</b> The aim is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast air temperature using relevant weather parameters. The model will be valuable for weather forecasting agencies, agricultural planning, and various industries dependent on weather conditions.<br>
									<b>Objective:</b> Implement Ridge Regression, a regularized linear regression technique, to construct a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting air temperature based on the identified significant weather variables. This model selection aims to achieve optimal performance while mitigating overfitting, a common challenge in machine learning.<br>
									<b>Analysis:</b> Determine the relative contribution of each weather parameter to the model's prediction of air temperature. Additionally, we will rigorously evaluate the model's performance using various statistical metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared value.

							<p>This plot above visualizes the air temperature trends throughout the year 2023. The blue line represents the daily temperature variations, while the red dashed line indicates the mean temperature for the year. The plot helps to observe temperature fluctuations over time and highlights the average temperature level for the entire year.</p>
							<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/project-1-1.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>This plot above illustrates the performance comparison of different regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Each boxplot represents the distribution of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) scores obtained through cross-validation for a specific model. The lower the RMSE, the better the model's predictive performance. This analysis aids in selecting the most suitable regression model for the given dataset based on its predictive accuracy.</p>
							<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/project-1-2.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>This plot above compares the target temperatures with the model temperatures over time. Each point represents a specific date, with the target temperatures indicated by one set of points and the model temperatures indicated by another set. The plot helps visualize the relationship between the observed and predicted temperatures, aiding in assessing the accuracy and performance of the model across different dates.</p>
