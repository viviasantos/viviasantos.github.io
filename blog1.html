    <h3>📌 Creating User Stories: Tips for Beginners in IT Projects</h3>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>When I started working as a Business Analyst, one of the most challenging tasks was writing <strong>clear and valuable user stories</strong>. I used to write long technical descriptions that made sense only to developers and didn't provide real value to the business team.</p>

      <p>After studying agile frameworks, talking with Product Owners, and reviewing many backlogs, I learned to write simpler and more effective stories using the classic format:</p>

      <p><strong>“As a [type of user], I want [a goal] so that [a benefit].”</strong></p>

      <h3>✏️ My Tips for Writing Better User Stories:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand the user</strong>: Who will use the feature? What do they need? Ask "why" several times if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it short and focused</strong>: One story = one goal. If you’re writing too much, it might be two or more stories.</li>
        <li><strong>Add acceptance criteria</strong>: Use bullet points to show what needs to be true for the story to be complete.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>✅ Example of a Good User Story:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        As a project manager,<br />
        I want to receive email notifications when a task is overdue,<br />
        so that I can take action and keep the project on track.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Acceptance Criteria:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Email is sent automatically when a task is 1 day overdue</li>
        <li>Message includes task name, project, and assigned person</li>
        <li>Email is sent only once per overdue task</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>📚 Final Thoughts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear user stories save time for developers and avoid miscommunication</li>
        <li>They also help test and validate features before coding</li>
      </ul>
